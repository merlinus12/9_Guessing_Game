Create a guessing game in which the user attempts to guess a number between
1 and 10.  The game should tell the user if they guess too high or too low.

The user should receive 3 tries to get the answer correct.  After each guess,
the program should tell the user how many attempts are remaining and, at the
end, should tell them they lost if they ran out of guesses.

The program should consist of at least 3 functions.  You can decide how best
to divide the tasks between the functions as you see fit.  Your program should 
use a "while" loop to control the number of guesses the user receives.

EXTRA CREDIT!
EC1) Let's make it bigger!  Pick a number between 1 and 100 and give your user
    20 guesses instead of just 1.  Hint: you can use functions to save a LOT
    of space...
EC2) There's more than one way to loop a program.  Try this instead of the while
loop:
    
    for guess in range(1,10):
            #your code goes here
